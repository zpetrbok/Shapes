# Shapes

This is a repository containing a few algorithms I wrote for a shape puzzle game.

# Features

1. DetectPolygon - Detecting whether a newly added edge to a planar graph forms a new cycle or not. C#
2. Shape Triangulator - Shape triangulation that supports concave and convex polygons.
3. Shape Triangular Holes - Shape triangulation that supports holes, concave and convex polygons, and overlapping vertices.
