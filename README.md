# Shapes

This is a repository containing a few algorithms I wrote for a shape puzzle game.

# Features

1. DetectPolygon - Detects whether an edge added to a planar graph forms a new cycle or not.
2. Shape Triangulator - Shape triangulation that supports concave and convex polygons. 
3. Shape Triangular Holes - Shape triangulation that supports holes, concave and convex polygons, and overlapping vertices.
4. Detect Point in Polygon - Detects whether a point is inside a polygon. Supports colinear points and overlapping points.
