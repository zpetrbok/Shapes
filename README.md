# ShapeTriangulation

This is a repository containing a few algorithms I wrote for a shape puzzle game.

# Features

1. Shape Triangulator - Shape triangulation that supports concave and convex polygons. 
2. Shape Triangular Holes - Shape triangulation that supports holes, concave and convex polygons, and overlapping vertices.
